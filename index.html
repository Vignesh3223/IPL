            <h1>Indian Premier League</h1>
            <p class="pt-2">The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a domestic, annual Twenty20 cricket tournament in India,
                organized by the IPL Governing Council, under the aegis of the Board of Control for Cricket in India
                (BCCI). It is the most watched Twenty20 tournament and the second-best paying[a] sporting league
                globally.

                IPL was established in 2008 and currently consists of ten teams in ten cities across India. The
                inaugural IPL season was won by Rajasthan Royals. As of May 2022, there have been fifteen seasons of
                the IPL tournament.

                The IPL tournament involves each team playing every other team twice in a home-and-away, double
                round-robin format. At the conclusion of the double round-robin league, on the basis of
                aggregate points, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams
                compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match
                titled "Eliminator"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualifies for the final match, the
                losing team gets another chance to qualify for the final match by playing the winning team of the
                Eliminator match; this match is titled Qualifier 2 The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2
                match moves onto the final match. The team that wins the final match is crowned the Indian Premier
                League champion.</p>
